	<h1>Lab 3 file Structure</h1>
		<p> The idea of this lab is to look about file structure and to reference
			images</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>After the summary we had trouble getting our image to be visible on the
		 web browser. We were	confused by this because we felt the code was right
		  and got a second	opinion from another class mate on slack.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> But we were still unable to figure out a solution.
				 Further assistance is needed</p>
