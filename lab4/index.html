	<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>
	<p> Within my labs I was having troubles with the images being coded showing
		up on m web browser. some of them would show up and show others would not.
		I also am having trouble with my link going to the right page or going to a
		new page at all. towards the end I decided I would go with what I have so far
		and then sign up for office hours to go over my work.</p>
